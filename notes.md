## NOTE

i think reading a book about technology or language does following things:

1. Lay down of a map to explore
   You know what basically is available, you know what everything is called
   creating a dictionary, table of contents if you wish in your ORIG_HEAD

2. It lets you get rid of fear to be eaten by this monstrous techonology
   As you know what to expect, you fear less and are more ready to explore
   it in deep.

3. It gives an awereness of some techonology history, its bugs, its intricacies
   very easily, in a processed way by someone already. It does shorten a gap between you and tech as well.

## DEVHINTS

- Git is the one of most important tools for a dev and so i think it is not enough
  to be a good user of but it is necessary to understand internals and become kinda
  superuser in it.
  cool website with exercises:
  https://gitexercises.fracz.com/committer/10cf199cfa25c87d3d94c2ab0a6cb44eaff25dc6

- Look at your work log every week. If something interesting happens, document it. Did you fix a major performance issue? Write it down. Did you find a weird bug in a third-party API? Document it. This stuff comes in handy during reviews or when you're job hunting.

- Every fix, every solution – no matter how small – needs to be "sold." Make a report. Build a dashboard. Because if you don't show off your work, someone else will take credit. Trust me on this one. That script that saves 10 minutes of deploy time? That's "deployment optimization" now. Put it in a nice graph. Management loves graphs.

- When someone comes with a problem, you fix it. Period. This is how you become the go-to person. No complicated strategy here – just be useful. Even if it's not your system, not your code, not your problem - make it your problem. Yeah, it means more work now, but it pays off big later.

- you always want to network a lot on all the events, everywhere

- the challange to deliver quality software, but fast is great to develop myself

- digesting information always try to make up a question deliberately,
  that will force u to listen carefully and learn.
  Also, to expend possible limits of knowledge from the resource.
