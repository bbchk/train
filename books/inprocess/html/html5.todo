Many of these design principles will be familiar to you if
you’ve ever dabbled in the microformats community (http://
microformats.org).

Document Type Declarations were intended for validators,
not browsers. The only time that a browser pays any attention
to a doctype is when it is performing “doctype switching”—
a clever little hack that switches rendering between quirks
mode and standards mode depending on the presence of a
decent doctype
